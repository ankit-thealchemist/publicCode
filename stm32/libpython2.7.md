In this tutorial we see how to install the stm32 cube ide on ubuntu 23.04. In ubuntu 23.04 there is no support for python 2.7, which is necessary for normal working of the stm32 cube ide. We can manually install the libpython2.7 on the machine by following these steps.

We need to install these 3 files in the specific order to install the libpython2.7.

1. Download and install the libpython2.7-minimal. which can be found on the link, http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python2.7/libpython2.7-minimal_2.7.18-13ubuntu1_amd64.deb  . Install it using the command sudo apt-get install ./libpython2.7-minimal_2.7.18-13ubuntu1_amd64.deb

2. Download and install the package libpython2.7-stdlib, which can be downloaded from the link,http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python2.7/libpython2.7-stdlib_2.7.18-13ubuntu1_amd64.deb Install it using the command sudo apt-get install ./libpython2.7-stdlib_2.7.18-13ubuntu1_amd64.deb

3. Download and install the package libpython2.7_2.7.18-13ubuntu1.1_arm64.deb, which can be downloaded from the link 	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python2.7/libpython2.7_2.7.18-13ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb

4. Now install the stm32 cube ide. Enjoy!
